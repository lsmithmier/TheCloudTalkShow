This week we drift around starting with the deal on certifications (yes, we want ’em so hear what we are thinking or perhaps drinking), a reminder that we do need those stinkin’ batches especially when they are so cheap, then a reminder that big brother has posted all our goodies on the internet (and how we can see what he did there), and finally another reminder of the .NET love Google is still giving and should be continuing to do so, the big W company notwithstanding …

Still looking for comments here (rather than those other communication venues) so let us know how we are doing!
