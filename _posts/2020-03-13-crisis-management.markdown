Ralph has been getting a lot of communication traffic on this useful communications helper found in the [https://lookbook.microsoft.com](https://lookbook.microsoft.com) site (The Look Book) for those who have Office 365, the very major Cloud Service mentioned more than once on the show … A big shout out to the PnP Community ( [https://github.com/SharePoint/PnP](https://github.com/SharePoint/PnP) ) and the Microsoft Team behind it. Even if you don’t use it, peruse the template and let it help for your own efforts.

Stay safe all!
