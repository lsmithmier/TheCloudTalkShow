Black Spy versus White Spy? not really â€¦ maybe PaaS and IaaS should be friends ðŸ˜‰

We talk about it and only have one real reference today to the (locked and thus no link) Wall Street Article on that Walmart thing on not using Amazon stuff â€¦ Oh well â€¦ whaddya gonna do?!

We also have a few images that we sort of forgot where we got â€™em so we will post those links here for proper credit as soon as we can.  Hopefully Uncle Lar will remember :: hint hint ::

Also, sorry the blog post was late as we got busy again and Larry moving and all (bigger and better! â€¦ his location not his weight! Gaah! :p)    Still waiting on the comments for where we should or should not go so hope to hear from a non-spammer soon!
