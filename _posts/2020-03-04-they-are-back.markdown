Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz Whatzit? Huh? Where’s the Coffee ….
Yes folks because we know we are about to get some people visiting after the recent “community outreach” Larry and I have been doing.

It’s a bit sad that we literally had no time in 2019 to even catch up but now …

So, anyways, this is just a place holder post to let you know the site is not forgotten (domain bill came but that’s not why we remembered ;-)) and there will be posts … looking at more Cloud related posts but also a look at various products that help us work with products that are, well, cloud products (go back to Episode 6 and see what we mean …)

Ok then … ready or not here they come …
