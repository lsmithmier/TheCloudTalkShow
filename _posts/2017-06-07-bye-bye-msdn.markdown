## Program notes for Episode 5
This week we tried to stick to the Network pillar script but we have a couple of side trips into the news about MSDN going to docs.microsoft.com and the compelling I9 processor that keeps us building physical stuff in our basements instead doing the cloud like we oughta, shoulda, etc. (So we are not exactly kicking and screaming on our way to full cloud-ness but there will always be room in our hearts and our racks for hardware because, because, because …. )

Here are the links for today in order of coverage so you can follow along quickly (but do note how we look for stuff if/when we have to)
