## Part 2 with Links!

Have fun digesting part 1 yet?  You may want to check it out before jumping in here as it gives context for the rest of the talk which goes all around the cloud from high to low, history to the present and and end note with some very key concepts.  Opinions not withstanding and a reminder that whatever is expressed is in the heat of the moment and not reflective of our day jobs or our fine partners and clients.

Enjoy the Show and the links below!
