Join Ralph and Larry as they talk to Rob Hirschfeld about how he is helping solve the problems below the cloud. RackN helps companies work with bare metal (not metal bears) programatically, so you can refactor your data center to meet changing needs.

We talk at the high level, but if you want to dig into some of the details about what goes on underneath a Continuously Integrated Data Center (CI DC) implementation you can read through Rob’s slides from a September 2019 presentation.

Learn about, and play with Infrastructure as Code by using Digital Rebar Platform (DRP) to provision Kubernetes on a Raspberry PI array with code.
