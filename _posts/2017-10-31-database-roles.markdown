We are back after too long a hiatus (#workingForaLiving)  and we hope the upcoming holiday season will mean more time to quickly turn more of these around.

Today, we look at Roles and why the Red Stapler guy is WAY more important than he is given credit for ðŸ˜‰  (Hey, we relate to him!)  And so as a precursor to further shows and a quick call back to one before (can you spot which one?) we give you the current installment!

Links for this show is in progress but follow along in the show for the bing/google searches we did to look stuff up LIVE!   Happy Spooky Day!
