## Episode 12 – Choco Goodness (with a wee bit of node version management)

Chocolatey is lately on our minds as we look to do things quickly because, hey, we got places to be ;-).  it started with getting Node Version Manager (NVM) on the PC side working and after some pain, Ralph stumbles onto using Chocolatey to do it.  So, it’s not so important that Ralph was doing this to make something in Office 365 (SharePoint online) work but for those doing that work (and it looks like there are lots of folks of late), perhaps it is extremely important.    On yeah, we installed Docker, too!  So Dev’s, enjoy this quick episode.
