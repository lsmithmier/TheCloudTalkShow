Ralph and Larry talk about Cloud Topics!:  
We talk Windows 11 from last time, BitCoin (no this is NOT SPAM! ... ok we like SPAM the food kind but, oh well, maybe just Ralph ...)  and somehow get a lot deeper and involved with the Low Code Cloud Power house, Power Platform services in Microsoft!  There is even a shout out to Lego programming so how can you not watch ;-)  

Links from the show today ...
