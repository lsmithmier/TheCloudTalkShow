## Episode 10 – Quick take on POSTGRESQL

So in this short hitter, Larry shares with us the Joy of POSTGRESQL (or at least the Vulcan version of Joy, eh Larry?)  as we continue on with our chat series.  Only a couple of links to share this time but this is a case of the little leading to a whole mess of a lot of stuff.  Enjoy!
