Storage is one of the main Pillars of the Cloud (along with Compute and Networking) and it gets a bit of due in this episode. There is a bit of deep dive into the Azure side of things especially with MS Build 2017 show material fresh on the internet as well as Ralphâ€™s continuing adventures with SharePoint Online (and related announcements there, too!)   Donâ€™t worry â€¦ there are more Storage topics to cover and we look forward to that!
