So there turns out to be quite a few steps before one can be a true to life podcaster on the internets â€¦

â€¦ and with that we ask you to stick around if you have already started checking this area out and we hope you will not be disappointed as we fix up the joint, so to speak.  Our main talk is about the cloud but we will start with what we know before we hit what we also want to know so any suggestions for things we should be looking at are totally welcome and just because we use PCâ€™s mostly, does not mean we canâ€™t look at everything else because, well â€¦ THE CLOUD has whatever we need, apparently ðŸ˜‰

More soon!
